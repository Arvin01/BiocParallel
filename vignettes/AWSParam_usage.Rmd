## AWS credentials

Get credentials from AWS dashboard --> IAM settings. 

The credentials need to be stored in a specific format on your machine under "~/.aws/credentials", more information given at
[AWS Credentials](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/a-new-and-standardized-way-to-manage-credentials-in-the-aws-sdks/)


```{r, include=FALSE}
aws.signature::use_credentials()
```
